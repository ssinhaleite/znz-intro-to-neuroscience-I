\section{Human \& Comparative Neuroanatomy}
\subsection{Human Neuroanatomy}
\subsubsection{Why do we need to know the brain}
The famous case of the HM pacient: Henry Gustav Molaison went through a surgery on brain to cure his epilepsy. However, during the surgery two holes were drilled in the front of his skull and a portion of his brain, the front half of the hippocampus on both sides, and most of the almond-shaped amygdala, was sucked out. The procedure went badly wrong and Henry, then aged 27, was left with no ability to store or retrieve new experiences. He lived the subsequent 55 years of his life, until his death in 2008, in the permanent present moment.

\subsubsection{Nervous system}
The nervous system is divided in two parts: the Central Nervous System (CNS) and
the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). Each part has its own divisions as we can see in Figure \ref{fig:nervousSystem}.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/division_nervous_system.jpg}
  \caption{Division of the Nervous System}
  \label{fig:nervousSystem}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item CNS
\subitem Brain
\subitem Spinal Cord
\item PNS
\subitem Somatic and autonomic nervous system
\end{itemize}

Both system contains gray and white matter.
In the PNS the gray matter contains \textbf{ganglia}: collection of neuron cell
bodies -, the white matter contains \textbf{nerves}: bundles of axons.
In the CNS the gray matter is divided in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neural cortex - gray matter on the surface of the brain
\item Nuclei - collection of neuron cell bodies in the interior of CNS
\item Centers - collection of neuron cell bodies in CNS, each center has specific processing functions
\item High centers - the most complex centers in brain.
\end{itemize}
The white matter in CNS is divided in two parts: the \textbf{tracts or fasciculus}: bundle of CNS axons
that share a common origin and destination -, and the \textbf{columns or funiculus}: several tracts (fasciculi) that form an anatomically distinct mass

The centers and tracts that connect the brain with other organs and system in
the body are called \textbf{pathways}. The ascending (sensory) pathway is called afferent.
The descending (motor) pathway is called efferent.

Figure \ref{fig:brain} shows the macro division of the brain (Telencephalon, Diencephalon, Brain stem and Medulla spinallis), in \ref{fig:brain2} we can see some views of the brain.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/viewsOfTheBrain.png}
  \caption{Division of the brain}
  \label{fig:brain}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/viewsOfTheBrain2.png}
  \caption{Views of the Brain}
  \label{fig:brain2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Telencephalon - or Forebrain}
The telencephalon (the biggest part of the brain) is divided in lobes, functional cortical areas, basal ganglia and limbic system.

The four lobes (frontal, occitopital, temporal and parietal) are presented in Figure \ref{fig:boundaries}.

\subparagraph{Gray matter}
The macroscopic boundaries of the gray matter are Gyri, Sulci and Commissural fiber tracts. Each one is divided as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gyri
\subitem precentral gyrus
\subitem postcentral gyrus
\subitem pars triangularis
\subitem angular gyrus
\subitem cingulate gyrus
\subitem parahippocampal gyrus
\item Sulci
\subitem central sulcus
\subitem lateral fissure
\subitem parieto-occipital sulcus
\subitem calcarine sulcus
\item Commissural fiber tracts
\subitem corpus callosum
\subsubitem Rostrum
\subsubitem Genu
\subsubitem Truncus
\subsubitem Splenium
\subitem anterior commissure
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:boundaries} shows the macroscopic boundaries of the gray matter. Besides the anatomical division, there is a functional division of the brain, where each area in the cerebral cortex has specific functional activities. The Wernicke's (language comprehension) and Broca's (speech production) areas are highlited in Figure \ref{fig:functionalBoundaries}.

In 1909 Korbinian Brodmann described areas of the cerebral cortex on the basis of
cytoarchitectural criteria. Areas differ in celltypes, layering and cell distribution, resulting in 52 Brodman Areas.

The human brain is gyrencephalic, i.e, is formed by giri, as the elephant brain. However other species can be  lissencephalic (the brain is smooth, without giri) as the domestic rabbit and the house mouse. Defects in the neuronal migration during early to mid gestation (12th to 24th weeks) leading to impaired development of gyri and sulci.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{imgs/macroscopic_boundaries.png}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{imgs/functional_boundaries.png}
  \caption{Functional Division - gray matter of the cortex}
  \label{fig:functionalBoundaries}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\subparagraph{White matter}

\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{r}{0.5\textwidth}
	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{imgs/macroscopic_whiteMatter.png}
	\caption{White matter - macroscopic fibers}
  	\label{fig:macroscopic_whiteMatter}
\end{wrapfigure}

The white matter can be divided macroscopically and microscopically. Macroscopically we talk about fibers and microscopically we talk about cells. Figure \ref{fig:macroscopic_whiteMatter} exemplify the macroscopic division and Figure \ref{fig:microscopic_whiteMatter} exemplify the microscopic division, where we can see microglias, astrocyte and oligodendrocytes cells.

\begin{itemize}
\item Comissural fibers (red): link areas between the two hemispheres (corpus callosum, anterior commissure, posterior commissure)
\item Association fibers (green): link cortical areas of the same hemisphere.
\item Projecting fibers (blue): link the cortex with subcortical areas of the brain and the spinal cord.
\end{itemize}

  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{imgs/microscopic_whiteMatter.png}
  \caption{White Matter - microscopic structures}
  \label{fig:microscopic_whiteMatter}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{Basal Ganglia}

The basal ganglia are the principal subcortical components of a family of neuronal circuits which link the thalamus and cerebral cortex. It is crucial for the initiation and modulation of voluntary movement by sending their output to the motor cortex via the thalamus. In addition, the basal ganglia also contribute to a variety of behavioral and cognitive functions other than voluntary movement.

The basal ganglia is divided in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Striatum: is the major recipient of inputs from the substantia nigra, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brain stem. In humans (and most primates) consist of the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the nucleus accumbens. In rats and mices consist of caudate putamen (human caudate nucleus + putamen) and nucleus accumbens.
\item Globus Palidus: is divided into external and internal segments.
\subitem The internal segment (GPi) sends projections to the thalamus and pedunculopontine nucleus (a group of cells located in the brain stem).
\subitem The external segment (GPe) sends projections to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and to the subthalamic nucleus.
\item Susbtantia Nigra: is a midbrain (mesencephalon) structure and contains a dense population of dopamine cells. The substantia nigra can be subdivided into substantia nigra pars compacta and pars reticulata.
\end{itemize}

One of the disorders of the basal ganglia is the parkinson's disease, where the
dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta are lost, it impairs motor skills, speech and other functions.

\subparagraph{Limbic system}
Divided in cingulate gyrus (superior portion of limbic lobe), parahippocampal gyrus (inferior portion of limbic lobe), hippocampus and amigdalar complex.
In Alzheimer's disease, the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; memory problems (especially spatial memories) and disorientation appear among the first symptoms. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage (such as in patients with progressed AD) may experience anterograde amnesia (the inability to form or retain new memories).
The amigdala is envolved in emotions.

\paragraph{Diencephalon}
The diencephalon is divided in thalamus, hipothalamus, epithalamus, subthalamus

\subparagraph{Thalamus}
The thalamus is the gatekeeper of the brain: it is important for the transfer of information from the periphery to sensory processing regions in the telencephalon. It has important gating (filtering) functions: it determines whether sensory information reaches conscious awareness in the neocortex and participates in the integration of motor information from the cerebellum and basal ganglia and transmits this information to cerebral areas concerned with movement.

\subparagraph{Hipothalamus}
The hipothalamus regulates several behaviors that are essential for homeostasis
and reproduction: growth, eating, drinking and maternal behavior, by regulating hormonal secretions from the pituitary gland. It is an important control center for the autonomic nervous system and for the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress-response system.

\subparagraph{Neuroendocrinollogy of Hipothalamus}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hipothalamus produces releasing hormones (rh) and inhibiting hormones (ih) that directly influence anterior pituitary hormone secretion.
\item Hipothalamus produces two hormones (oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone) that are stored in the posterior pituitary.
\item Hupothalamus overseesthe ANS (?)thereby helping to stimulate the adrenal medulla via sympathetic innervation.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Epithalamus}
epithelial roof of the third ventricle, habenula, pineal body and afferent/efferent connections. It is responsible for the secretion of melatonin, regulation of day-night cycles, information processing related to olfaction.

\subparagraph{Subthalamus}
It is the continuation of the tegmentum. Functionally part of the basal ganglia (motor control).
